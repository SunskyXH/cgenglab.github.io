abstract: We propose a novel cross-sectional structural analysis technique that efficiently detects critical stress inside a 3D object. We slice the object into cross-sections and compute stress based on bending momentum equilibrium. Unlike traditional approaches based on finite element methods, our method doesnâ€™t require a volumetric mesh or solution of linear systems, enabling interactive analysis speed. Based on the stress analysis, the orientation of an object is optimized to increase mechnanical strength when manufactured with 3D printing.
