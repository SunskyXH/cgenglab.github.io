abstract: We present a novel interactive tool for garment design that enables, for the first time, interactive bidirectional editing between 2D patterns and 3D high-fidelity simulated draped forms. This provides a continuous, interactive, and natural design modality in which 2D and 3D representations are simultaneously visible and seamlessly maintain correspondence. Artists can now interactively edit 2D pattern designs and immediately obtain stable accurate feedback online, thus enabling rapid prototyping and an intuitive understanding of complex drape form.
